# CinemaApp

CinemaApp is an information system to manage cinemas and associated information.

This project was developed as a four-phased project in Laboratório de Software (Software Lab) subject in [ISEL](https://www.isel.pt) during my degree in Computer Science and Computer Engineering.

There were four phases in the project:

* [Phase 1](/wiki/Phase-1.md) => The objective was to implement the database accordingly to [this](/wiki/img/Modelo_EA.jpg) entity–relationship model and a simple console application to interact with the database via commands simillar to HTTP requests.
* [Phase 2](/wiki/Phase-2.md) => The objective was to add an entity to the domain and the concept of `headers` into the commands
* [Phase 3](/wiki/Phase-3.md) => The objective was setup a HTTP server exposing the GET operations
* [Phase 4](/wiki/Phase-4.md) => The objective was to deploy the app in [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and use [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API to retrieve information about movies
