# Phase 4

## Introduction

This document describes the requirements for the fourth and final phase of the Software Laboratory project.

## Requirements

### Using PostgreSQL

Use the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) Relational Database Management System, instead of SQL Server.
* Install PostgreSQL on the development machines.
* Obtain and use a [JDBC driver](https://jdbc.postgresql.org) for PostgreSQL.
* Change both the DDL and DML statements to use the PostgreSQL dialect.
* Use the `JDBC_DATABASE_URL` environment variable to configure the PostgreSQL [connection settings](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/80/connect.html).

### Hosting on Heroku

Host the application on the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
* Create an [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) free account. Heroku is an example of a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) provider.
* Install the [Heroku CLI (Command Line Interface)](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) on all the development machines.
* On the Heroku web site, create a new [application](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)
  * The name should follow the following structure:`isel-ls-1718-2-li4<turma>-g<nÃºmero-do-grupo>`.
  * Select the "Europe" region.
* On the application home page, provision the "Heroku Postgres" add-on using the "Hobby Dev - Free" plan.
  * The `JDBC_DATABASE_URL` environment variable will be automatically added to Java the execution environment.
* Change the `build.gradle` file to include the `application` plug-in, define the startup class, and define the `stage` task.
* Create the `settings.gradle` file with the project name.
* Create the `Procfile` file with the Heroku project name and the activation string.
* On the command line, do `heroku login`.
* On the command line, inside the project root folder, do `heroku git:remote -a isel-ls-1718-2-li4XX-gXX`. This will create a Git remote pointing to the Heroku repository.

### Use the Movies API

* When creating a movie, use the [Movies API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=en) to fetch the movie information based on the given movie identifier, which becomes the only mandatory parameter.

### Logging

Add logging of any relevant event information into the developed application.
Use the [Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J)](http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html), configured with the binding for the [Simple](http://www.slf4j.org/apidocs/org/slf4j/impl/SimpleLogger.html) implementation.
See [TimeServlet.java](/wiki/examples/TimeServlet.java) for an example.

### Resource creation via the HTTP interface

The main goal for this requirement is to add support for the commands with `POST` method in the HTTP interface.
For that, the representations for the following resources should be augmented with HTML forms:

* `/cinemas` - form to add a new cinema. 
* `/movies` - form to add a new movie.
* `/cinemas/{cid}` - form to add a new theater.
* `/cinemas/{cid}/theaters/{tid}`- form to add a new session.
* `/cinemas/{cid}/theaters/{tid}/sessions/{sid}` - form to add a new ticket

Each one of these forms must, when submitted, send a POST request to the associated resource. 
For instance:
* The representation returned on a `GET /cinemas` request should contain a form with the field `name`.
* This form, when submitted, must send a `POST` request to `/cinemas` containing this field in the body.
* If the `POST` request is successful, i.e. a new cinema was created, its response should be a `303 See Other` with the `Location` header pointing to the created cinema (e.g. `/cinemas/some-id`).
